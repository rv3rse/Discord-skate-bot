#Skate bot

This is a discord.py bot I have created for my skater buddies.

It was initialy created for the game SkaterXL so that you can get trick ideas or lines but this can also be used to play a game of skate.

<u><b>Commands:</b></u>

<u>Tricks:</u>

.Beginner - This gives you a random beginner trick. E.g: kickflip.

.Intermediate - This gives you a random intermediate trick. E.g: Variel flip.

.Advanced - This gives you a random advanced trick. E.g: Double hardflip.

<u>Lines:</u>

.Beginnerline - This gives a random beginner line. E.g: Kickflip ~ Nose manual.

.Intermediateline - This gives a random intermediate line. E.g: Hardflip ~ Crooked grind.

.Advancedline - This gives a random advanced line. E.g: Forward kickflip ~ Manual revert.

I am going to add more features to this bot and I hope you enjoy!
